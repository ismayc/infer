[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/infer)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=infer) [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/andrewpbray/infer.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/andrewpbray/infer) [![AppVeyor Build Status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/andrewpbray/infer?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/andrewpbray/infer) [![Coverage Status](https://img.shields.io/codecov/c/github/andrewpbray/infer/master.svg)](https://codecov.io/github/andrewpbray/infer/?branch=master)


The objective of this package is to perform statistical inference using an expressive statistical grammar that coheres with the `tidyverse` design framework.

### Installation

------------------------------------------------------------------------

To install the current stable version of `infer` from CRAN:

```{r}
install.packages("infer")
```

To install the developmental version of `infer`, make sure to install `remotes` first:

```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("andrewpbray/infer")
```

To install the cutting edge version of `infer` (do so at your own risk), make sure to install `remotes` first:

```{r}
install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("andrewpbray/infer", ref = "develop")
```

To see the things we are working on with the package as vignettes/Articles, check out 
the developmental `pkgdown` site at <https://infer-dev.netlify.com>.

### Contributing

We welcome others helping us make this package as user friendly and efficient as possible. Please review
our [contributing](https://github.com/andrewpbray/infer/blob/develop/CONDUCT.md) and [conduct](CONDUCT.md) guidelines. Of particular interest is
helping us to write `testthat` tests and help us in building vignettes that show how to (and how NOT to)
use the package.

### Examples

------------------------------------------------------------------------

These examples assume that `mtcars` has been overwritten so that the variables `cyl`, `vs`, `am`, `gear`, and `carb` are `factor`s.

```{r}
mtcars <- as.data.frame(mtcars) %>%
  mutate(cyl = factor(cyl),
          vs = factor(vs),
          am = factor(am),
          gear = factor(gear),
          carb = factor(carb))
```

Hypothesis test for a difference in proportions (using the formula interface 
`y ~ x` in `specify()`):

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  specify(am ~ vs, success = "1") %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 100, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in props", order = c("1", "0"))
```

Confidence interval for a difference in means (using the non-formula interface
giving both the `response` and `explanatory` variables in `specify()`):

```{r}
mtcars %>%
  specify(response = mpg, explanatory = am) %>%
  generate(reps = 100, type = "bootstrap") %>%
  calculate(stat = "diff in means", order = c("1", "0"))
```

Note that the formula and non-formula interfaces work for all implemented inference
procedures in `infer`. Use whatever is more natural for you. If you will be doing
modeling using functions like `lm()` and `glm()`, we recommend you begin to use the
formula `y ~ x` notation as soon as possible though.

Other examples are available in the package vignettes.
